I was born an raised in Austin Texas.  I have lived in Austin all but 8 years of my life.  I graduated high school in 1995 and move to Arlington Texas to attend the University of Texas at Arlington.  I moved back to Austin in 2003 where I would soon find my passion in Real Estate.  Over the next 15 years I worked in the capacity of a Realtor, Real Estate Investor and Home Inspector.

Within my career, which has always centered around Real Estate I have always felt there was something more for me to do.  I truly enjoy the service and interaction with people.  In 2018 I took steps towards venturing into CBD.  I experienced an amazing CBD product from American Shaman and I knew instantly it was something I wanted to be a part of.  I was able to see drastic improvements in my mom's mobility that I thouht to myself.  I want to have a  CBD store in the heart of Austin with amazing products.  I envisioned myself helping and assisted those in need with excellent natural alternatives to pain relief.   Capital CBD American Shaman was designed to become a "Wellness Center".
