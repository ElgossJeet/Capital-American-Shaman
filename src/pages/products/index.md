With CBNight Water Soluble CBN Oil, you will not experience any side effects as you’re using nature’s cannabinoids and terpenes to softly encourage exactly what you’ve been looking for, better sleep. This product is the first of its kind and we’re excited to let the public buy CBN online after months of testing.</p>

  - author: Marissa Neunaber
    quote: I highly recommend Capital CBD American Shaman on Burnet Rd. The
      establishment is very nice, clean and inviting. Mike is very knowledgeable
      about all the products and his customer service if great! If you’re
      thinking about trying CBD, this is definitely where you should go.
  - author: Booker Gilbert
    quote: Great experience while visiting Capital CBD American Shaman. Very clean
      environment and was greeted as if we were long time friends. Michael was
      very knowledgeable and respectful of the fact that I didn’t really know
      what I was looking for. He simply asked a few questions about my needs,
      explained the benefits of their products, which eventually allowed me to
      make confident selection.
  - quote: I would definitely recommend Capital CBD to anyone looking to get into
      using CBD or anyone who just wants quality products. We talked to Kelley
      when we went in and she was so welcoming and kind. She definitely creates
      an awesome environment for learning and growth! We purchased the 25mg
      gummies and got to try the lemon drops at 30mg a dropper and my back pain
      disappeared by the end of our conversation. My best friend has epilepsy
      and Kelly offered us some educational information to give to her. I can
      really tell Capital CBD is a business that will continue to grow because
      of their awesome staff and amazing products.
    author: Annie Olivarez
  - quote: Capital CBD has been my favorite place to shop for all of my cbd needs.
      They have gummies, water solubles, pre-rolls, flower and more all in an
      upscale environment. Quality products made here in the U.S.!  If you're
      new to the CBD scene these folks know everything about nature's gift. CBD
      helps me with anxiety. I use the water soluble pink lemonade. Check em
      out!
