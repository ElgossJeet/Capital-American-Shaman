**What are terpenes?** 

Terpenes are compounds produced in the flower clusters of the cannabis plants.They are basically essential oils found in plants.There are around 200 terpenes in cannabis. Terpenes are what give cannabis its distinct aromas/flavors and have been utilized by humans for thousands of years in aromatherapy. Terpenes have beneficial effects and work synergistically with cannabinoids like CBD, CBG and THC – this combined experience is what is defined as the entourage effect.

**Can I give my pet CBD (my dog, cat, etc.)?**

Yes you can.Pets can benefit from CBD for many of the same conditions as humans: pain, seizures, inflammation, and anxiety. CBD is safe to use for pets but their dosage in most cases will be much smaller than in humans. Dogs have a higher concentration of cannabinoid receptors in their brain. This makes them very sensitive to THC.Trace amounts of THC, like the amount in a full spectrum CBD hemp oil, is beneficial for animals. We recommend you speak with a veterinarian (holistic veterinarian) before you start a CBD regime for your pet.

You should try to keep the CBD tincture under your tongue for 30 – 60 seconds. The longer you can hold it there, usually the better it will absorb into your system.
