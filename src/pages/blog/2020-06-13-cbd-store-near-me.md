So you turn to google in search of a “CBD Store near me”.  Google rewards you with a list of CBD stores in North Austin.  You search through reviews and websites but still don’t know where you should start on your journey for the best CBD store with an excellent line of products.

We have compiled a few things to consider to assist you in your quest for Austin’s #1 CBD store.  Most people go to the top of the search list but sometimes the top of a google search only indicates the company that’s been at that particular area the longest or who has put more money and effort into digital marketing over time. 

The goal here is to center the search around CBD.  One of the first things to look for is a reputable company.  A reputable company will at a bare minimum provide you with the amount of CBD advertised and follow industry standards.  The CBD industry is still catching up to the rapid expansion we have witnessed over the last few years.  As you have probably heard it’s like the wild West in many senses.  Looking at companies that are certified by the U.S. Hemp Authority takes out a lot of the guess work.  The US Hemp authority adds credibility to a brand through trusted independent third-party certification, exemplifies truth in labeling and instills consumer confidence in product.  It also assures you are using farming and industry best practices compliant with applicable regulations.  It’s difficult to argue against any of those points if a company wants to air on the side of transparency.  The U.S. Hemp Authority® Certification Program is our industry's initiative to provide high standards, best practices, and self-regulation, giving consumers and retailers confidence in hemp and CBD products.

Aside from the U.S. Hemp Authority designation a pleasant environment with an educated staff that really knows CBD can be helpful.  At Capital American Shaman we are always happy to assist.  We look forward to helping you find the right product for you.  A warm, friendly productive experience for customers is always top priority.
